            <p>The Fight for Greenland offers a unique insight into the heated debate about independency, language, and
                identity, that rages in modern-day Greenland. What does the future hold for Greenland? Should Greenland
                become a sovereign state or on the contrary strengthen its ties to Denmark? The film follows four
                strong-willed and dynamic young Greenlanders that disagree on which direction their country should
                follow, but all are fighting for a better Greenland.</p>

                <h2>This year, CPH:DOX opens with a brand new and incredibly relevant film from within the eye of the
                    storm. A clever and complex film that not only contributes to insight but also contributes to a
                    human presence which is necessary to understand the need for freedom and the long historical
                    connection to Denmark. We could not have asked for a more important film to open with.</h2>

                    <p>20-year old rapper, Josef Tarrak, has already made a name for himself as the most important voice
                        of his generation. At the age of 16, he had his breakthrough with the smash hit, Tupilak, that
                        was the first song to express the widespread frustration about the dominance of the Danish
                        language in Greenland. </p>

                        make Greenland more Greenlandic by reviving parts of the Greenlandic culture otherwise
                        suppressed by the Danification. </p>
