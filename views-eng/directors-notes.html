            <p>
                For many years, I have been very fascinated by Greenland and the Arctic, and the idea for this film
                emerged in 2011 when I was preparing for an icebreaker expedition. I had to film Danish scientists
                collecting scientific data to support the Danish claim on the North Pole (the sea floor of the Arctic
                Ocean). I was puzzled as to why the Danish Parliament had granted an amount in the triple-digit range to
                extend the Greenlandic territory, knowing that Greenland has set the course towards independence.
                <br><br>
                During an extended research and development phase, I have cast four young Greenlanders who represent the
                main currents within the independence debate in Greenland. I want to expose the enthusiasm, the power,
                and the creative energy of the Greenlandic youth - forces that the four characters represents so very
                well and a side of the country that we never really hear about in Denmark. It has been vital to me to
                gain the trust of the characters in order to tell the story from a Greenlandic perspective. Thus, I have
                spent long periods in Greenland - a total of eight months during a period of three years. Casting the
                characters, apart from finding charismatic personalities, it was important to me, that all the
                characters had an activist approach to their mission. Because only when words are turned into actual
                actions, our ideals and our dreams are challenged for real.
                <br><br>
                Documentaries are often told from a single perspective, but in this film, I have tried to look from
                various perspectives at the highly polarized independence and identity debate in Greenland. The film
                does not side with any of the perspectives but is sympathetic to all the characters’ hopes and dreams.
                In other words, I care for and side with all the characters and leave it to the audience to make up
                their own minds.
                <br><br>
                All over the world, independence movements are gaining ground, and surely, The Fight for Greenland
                addresses this issue, but to me personally, this film is basically about what it takes to belong. My
                hope is that this film will help create the basis for a more nuanced dialogue between Greenland and
                Denmark and between the two sides of the independence debate. </p>
